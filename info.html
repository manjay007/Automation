<strong>March 14, 2012:</strong> I had a random moment of inspiration in the middle of the night, which I took advantage of to produce my newest poem, <em>In the Night Sky</em>. Click <a href=”/writing/poems.html” target=”_blank”>here</a> to enjoy!</p>

<strong>February 14, 2012:</strong> In honor of Valentine’s Day, I have uploaded two <a href=”/writing/poems.html” target=”_blank”>poems</a> and three <a href=”/artwork/sketches.html” target=”_blank”>sketches</a> with a subtle but nuanced romantic bent. I challenged myself to think of love outside of the traditional cliche conceptions so those without significant others can still appreciate this lovely holiday. We all have so much more love in our lives than the stereotypical portrayal of romantic affinity; we should open our eyes to all of the different ways in which we are blessed and appreciate it!</p>
